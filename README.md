# Stendeback-Password-Encryption
Helps the user generate a random secure password to help store their files safely.

As this project required me to understand the basics of Javascript, including how to write and call functions, create variables using var, let, or const, and to properly formulate if, if else, functions, and for statements, I can happily say that my experiences within this project have helped me to better understand how important it can be to utilize javascript as a web developer. I formulated functions and called them within the starter code given to me. The HTML and CSS were already complete, so my job was to fill out the rest of the JS file to help with functionality and fix any bugs or errors that happened along the way. The biggest problem I ran into was a dupication in the alert system, which was eventually shot down by my debugging and finding out I was calling the function twice. All in all I feel confident in these basic JS skills, and very excited to keep growing with them on my journey!
